(Write your report in place of this auto-filled message) — For quicker response, write your issue report in Matrix chat channel. [#futuramerlin:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23futuramerlin:matrix.org) I only actively monitor Matrix, and just writing in the issue tracker here does not send me a notification there!

I will only see issue reports and merge requests in GitHub quickly if I am lucky — I do not regularly check it. The chat link above will give me a notification. I check it most days, so generally will see and respond to the chat within a day.

Thanks,
