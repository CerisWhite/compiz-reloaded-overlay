## For quicker response, write your issue report in Matrix chat channel. [#futuramerlin:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23futuramerlin:matrix.org) The issue tracker is not actively monitored

I will only see issue and merge reports in GitHub quickly if I am lucky â€” I do not actively monitor it. The chat link above will give me a notification. I check it most days, so generally will see and respond within a day.
